Notes:

Conventions: This code uses my habits, and not anything that I recommend or discourage, 
	but it works for me. 

- all classes begin with a small 'c' - such as cBicycle. 
- struct types begin with underscore: '_'
- enumerated types begin with a small 'e'
- I mostly use a style called simplifed Hungarian notation:
	- pointers always start with 'p'
	- I sometimes preface other types: integers use 'n', strings with 'str', etc.
	- I don't bother with the 'm_' for class members. Almost everything is a class
		member or an obvious parameter, so there's no point.

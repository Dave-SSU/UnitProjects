The gnuchess.exe and gnuchesr.exe included here are compiled from
unmodified GNU Chess 4.0.77 sources, available on the Internet as
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gnuchess-4.0.pl77.tar.gz. To recompile,
get the source and unpack it using GNU gzip and GNU tar, then recompile
with Microsoft Visual C++ by typing the command "nmake /f Makefile.nt"
to an MSDOS Prompt box on Windows 95 or Windows NT.  If you have a
different compiler, you are on your own; sorry.  Afterwards, rename
gnuchesx.exe to gnuchess.exe.
